<p>Be it curse or gift, I am french-speaking first before english, like many other africans, asians or europeans. </p>
<p>The past centuries glows on the French language, with its literature giants, Victor Hugo, Emile Zola, Guy de Maupassant, Baudelaire; the memory of Paris attracting Americans in the 30s; or French being the lingua frinca of diplomacy and international relations in 17th and 18th century. We please in learning conjugation, intricate grammar rules, writing structured essays that would make Michel Eyquem de Montaigne proud. And we delight in discussing recent french literature we&#8217;ve read, be it an easy Albert Camus book or a circumvoluted Proust work. </p>
<p>The truth though is that English, or rather American language, is now the elephant sharing a small room with the puny French language. The attraction of North America is strong, from Paris to Rabat to Lebanon or even far-way capitals like Antananarivo. For many, it&#8217;s about going to New York city. For us french-speaking youth, it&#8217;s Montréal though.</p>
<p>I did not know about Québec sovereignty struggles. Or potholes. Or poutine. Or beautiful Québec girls :) Montréal&#8217;s image worldwide is a french-speaking metropole well set in the North American system. A stop away from New York city, or Toronto and Chicago a flight away. There would be snow and Canadian flags but you would get McGill university and good natured people. That&#8217;s what makes people line up in embassies in North Africa, France, or sub-Saharan africa.</p>
<p>One striking example is my high school class back in Nairobi, Kenya. Between half to two-thirds have been attracted to Montréal, in one way or another. Education, work, family. Many have worked to get a comfortable job. A few more ambitious and more inspired are artists or entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>You would understand that it&#8217;s the same case for any other capitals in Africa or Europe, with young creative people fleeing here. Montreal is New York city for them, a place where the heavy burden of the French government and society doesn&#8217;t apply, a meeting point where no-one judges your orientation, a platform for many to realize their dreams.</p>
<p>Of course, it doesn&#8217;t have the fast-paced lifestyle of Paris, nor its beautiful architecture. It doesn&#8217;t have either the density and aggressiveness of New York city. Upon arrival though, you are greeted with kindness and warmth that makes you want to give back and create beautiful things.</p>
<p>Will it change? I&#8217;m fully aware that China will rule 21st Century and we&#8217;d better turn our eyes to the Far East instead of North America. Or perhaps young Africans should think more of building in their own countries instead of immigrating to a far way cold country. Or as imperfect as it is, France is still one of the most advanced countries in the world, be it culturally or economically. In 2013 though, Montreal is still the premier destination for young franchophiles. Go west.. or rather go to Montreal, young man! </p>
