<p>Be it curse or gift, I am french-speaking first before english, like many other africans, asians or europeans. </p>
<p>The past centuries glows on the French language, with its literature giants, Victor Hugo, Emile Zola, Guy de Maupassant, Baudelaire; the memory of Paris attracting Americans in the 30s; or French being the lingua frinca of diplomacy and international relations in 17th and 18th century. We please in learning conjugation, intricate grammar rules, writing structured essays that would make Michel Eyquem de Montaigne proud. And we delight in discussing recent french literature we&#8217;ve read, be it an easy Albert Camus book or a circumvoluted Proust work. </p>
<p>The truth though is that English, or rather American language, is now the elephant sharing a small room with the puny French language. The attraction of North America is strong, from Paris to Rabat to Lebanon or even far-way capitals like Antananarivo. For many, it&#8217;s about going to New York city. For us french-speaking youth, it&#8217;s Montréal though.</p>
<p>I did not know about Québec sovereignty struggles. Or potholes. Or poutine. Or beautiful Québec girls :) Montréal&#8217;s image worldwide is a french-speaking metropole well set in the North American system. A stop away from New York city, or Toronto and Chicago a flight away. There would be snow and Canadian flags but you would get McGill university and good natured people. That&#8217;s what makes people line up in embassies in North Africa, France, or sub-Saharan africa.</p>
<p>One striking example is my high school class back in Nairobi, Kenya. Between half to two-thirds have been attracted to Montréal, in one way or another. Education, work, family. Many have worked to get a comfortable job. A few more ambitious and more inspired are artists or entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>You would understand that it&#8217;s the same case for any other capitals in Africa or Europe, with young creative people fleeing here. Montreal is New York city for them, a place where the heavy burden of the French government and society doesn&#8217;t apply, a meeting point where no-one judges your orientation, a platform for many to realize their dreams.</p>
<p>Of course, it doesn&#8217;t have the fast-paced lifestyle of Paris, nor its beautiful architecture. It doesn&#8217;t have either the density and aggressiveness of New York city. Upon arrival though, you are greeted with kindness and warmth that makes you want to give back and create beautiful things.</p>
<p>Will it change? I&#8217;m fully aware that China will rule 21st Century and we&#8217;d better turn our eyes to the Far East instead of North America. Or perhaps young Africans should think more of building in their own countries instead of immigrating to a far way cold country. Or as imperfect as it is, France is still one of the most advanced countries in the world, be it culturally or economically. In 2013 though, Montreal is still the premier destination for young franchophiles. Go west.. or rather go to Montreal, young man! </p>

<p>When you live in the tropics, life is easy. I am not thinking about economic development or any reference to politics, but to the hot and sweet weather which allows you to go out with just a plain t-shirt all year long. Be it december or june, it&#8217;s easy to wake up, pick a t-shirt and only worry if it&#8217;s rainy or hot.</p>
<p>Those are my memories from Antananarivo, Madagascar or Nairobi, Kenya. There were of course sometimes chilly nights, rains that would last throughout the day, or a hot sun that would darken your skin for a few days. That was all though. When I think about it, weather didn&#8217;t really matter.</p>
<p>Even in France, I only distinguished between winter and summer. In december, you&#8217;d take your fashionable jacket from the closet, along with the occasional leather gloves. Friends would also get scarves and a hat. When it snowed, it always made news, but you learn quickly that snow never lasts than a few hours in a temperate country like France.</p>
<p>What did spring mean back then? For me, it was used in literature to evocate life, perhaps love and renewal. Fall on the other hand was used in cinema or books for horror movies, or memories of past life.</p>
<p>I am sure for cities like New York city, Tokyo or Berlin, it&#8217;s the same sentiment towards the weather.</p>
<p>In Québec, weather regulates people&#8217;s mind. It&#8217;s everyone autocrat, and has profound impacts in business, economics of love or work &amp; play patterns.</p>
<p>Winter brings in Québec the tragedy of extreme cold and mountains of snow. Temperatures as low as -35C come often each year: you can see your own breath, you feel the inside of your nose and throat freeze, and it&#8217;s an exercise to walk on dark ice. Fortunately, days around -15C are more common.</p>
<p>Consequences are vast. You can&#8217;t just stroll around or take your time to discuss in the streets. Winter is then definitively the season where Montrealers work and try to be efficient at what they are doing. Even if you want to go outside for fresh air, it&#8217;s a deliberate and well-planned outing, with proper equipment and timing. Cars have winter tires. People have winter coats, a tuque, winter boots and other layers of warm clothing. And when they are not outside, a Montrealer is a refugee in his office or home, with heaters at full capacity, and all the comforts of modern 21st technology.</p>
<p>Summer brings heat waves. It&#8217;s around 30C, and sometimes humidity raises through the roof. If you&#8217;ve been to a tropical forest near the equator, such as central america or congo, it&#8217;s the same sensation… a shower is needed every 3 hours.</p>
<p>What does 30C weather bring to the city? Montrealers have learned that you have to make the most of good weather, so music &amp; art festivals are lined-up, back-to-back during the summer. The respectable Montrealer learns how be nonchalant on a Mont-Royal terrace. Friends mention sailing in a lake nearby, while american and chinese tourists flock streets. It&#8217;s an atmosphere similar to a popular brazilian destination.</p>
<p>And between the two, we have the beautiful seasons of spring and fall.</p>
<p>Spring extends the days, and melts the snow that was covering the ground, bushes and trees. It&#8217;s a slow revival that brings the sometimes foul but often beautiful smell of the nature coming back to life. With temperatures bouncing back between -5C to 15C, you see for the first time in many months young girls happy to wear skirts or guys with shorts… with still their winter coats. There are couples with new love, or animals like squirrels which have been hiding for most of the winter. A true revival of life.</p>
<p>Fall on the other hand signals the end of the party. Days are shorter, and the color palette turns to shades of grey and brown. It&#8217;s also the time where students go back to school, or workers come back from holidays, if they took any.</p>
<p>With its 4 distinct seasons that permeates fully the montrealer, one begins to truly appreciate the season cycle. Birth. Life. Decline. Death. It brings raw emotions and makes you feel alive, either as a survivor in winter, or as a hedonist in summer.</p>
<p>And ladies and gentlemen, that&#8217;s why I love the Montreal weather, anytime of the year.</p>
